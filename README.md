## Credit
This script is a fork of [goosewood/blurlock-neofetch](https://github.com/goosewood/blurlock-neofetch). Although I have made a lot of changes, and the code of this repository has no longer worked (the main reason is that neofetch does not support the scrot option after this [issue #1001](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch/issues/1001)), but I'm still very grateful for him/her ideas and code for giving me inspiration. Without your help, I couldn't have done it.
